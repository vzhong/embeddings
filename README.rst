Embeddings is a python package that provides pretrained word embeddings for natural language processing and machine learning.

NOTE: there are several people looking to take over the pip `embeddings` package on Pypi for their own project. As a result, please install from github instead.

Instead of loading a large file to query for embeddings, ``embeddings`` is backed by a database and fast to load and query:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> %timeit GloveEmbedding('common_crawl_840', d_emb=300)
    100 loops, best of 3: 12.7 ms per loop
    
    >>> %timeit GloveEmbedding('common_crawl_840', d_emb=300).emb('canada')
    100 loops, best of 3: 12.9 ms per loop
    
    >>> g = GloveEmbedding('common_crawl_840', d_emb=300)
    
    >>> %timeit -n1 g.emb('canada')
    1 loop, best of 3: 38.2 Âµs per loop


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install git+https://github.com/vzhong/embeddings.git  # from github


Usage
-----

Upon first use, the embeddings are first downloaded to disk in the form of a SQLite database.
This may take a long time for large embeddings such as GloVe.
Further usage of the embeddings are directly queried against the database.
Embedding databases are stored in the ``$EMBEDDINGS_ROOT`` directory (defaults to ``~/.embeddings``). Note that this location is probably **undesirable** if your home directory is on NFS, as it would slow down database queries significantly.


.. code-block:: python

    from embeddings import GloveEmbedding, FastTextEmbedding, KazumaCharEmbedding, ConcatEmbedding
    
    g = GloveEmbedding('common_crawl_840', d_emb=300, show_progress=True)
    f = FastTextEmbedding()
    k = KazumaCharEmbedding()
    c = ConcatEmbedding([g, f, k])
    for w in ['canada', 'vancouver', 'toronto']:
        print('embedding {}'.format(w))
        print(g.emb(w))
        print(f.emb(w))
        print(k.emb(w))
        print(c.emb(w))


Docker
------

If you use Docker, an image prepopulated with the Common Crawl 840 GloVe embeddings and Kazuma Hashimoto's character ngram embeddings is available at `vzhong/embeddings <https://hub.docker.com/r/vzhong/embeddings>`_.
To mount volumes from this container, set ``$EMBEDDINGS_ROOT`` in your container to ``/opt/embeddings``.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run --volumes-from vzhong/embeddings -e EMBEDDINGS_ROOT='/opt/embeddings' myimage python train.py
